**Volume Control Using Gestures Open CV Project**

This project demonstrates how to control the volume of your device using hand gestures. It utilizes OpenCV library in Python to capture video from the device camera and detect hand gestures using the Haar Cascade classifier. The volume control is achieved by simulating key press events in Python.

**Usage**

Run the script: python volume_control.py

The script will open up a window displaying the video captured from the device camera. Place your hand in front of the camera and use the following gestures to control the volume:

Spread five fingers out, and move them up and down to adjust the volume.
