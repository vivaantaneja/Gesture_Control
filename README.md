## Problem statement

To validate a hand tracking module that can detect and track the movements of the hand in real-time and recognize specific hand gestures for controlling electronic devices or applications.

## Description of problem

The hand-tracking gesture control project aims to allow users to control the volume of their laptops by simply adjusting their fingers. This project will utilize a webcam or a depth camera to track the movement and position of the user's hand and fingers. The system will then interpret the hand gestures to adjust the laptop's volume. The system will be built using Python programming language and OpenCV computer vision library. OpenCV provides a variety of tools for image processing, including hand and gesture recognition. The system will use the Haar cascade classifier algorithm to detect the user's hand in the video feed from the webcam. Once the user's hand is detected, the system will use computer vision techniques to track the movement and position of the user's fingers. The project will use a pre-trained deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to recognize different hand gestures. The system will interpret the user's hand gestures to adjust the laptop's volume. For example, extending the thumb up and the index finger down could increase the volume, while the opposite motion could decrease the volume. The project can be tested on a Windows or macOS operating system laptop. The final system will be an application that runs in the background and detects hand gestures from the webcam feed. The application will then send commands to the operating system to adjust the volume of the laptop. Overall, this project will provide a convenient and hands-free way for users to control the volume of their laptops. It will demonstrate the capabilities of computer vision and deep learning in creating intuitive and interactive user interfaces.
At the end of our project, to analyze the reviews, we used sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is one of many tasks that AI agents can perform. AI agents can be programmed to perform various tasks, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, image recognition, decision-making, and many more.
